# PasswordVerification

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 16.0.3.

Task:
Create applications to test password strength

The essence of the assignment:
• Create a field for entering a password, under the field add 3 sections which will show the strength of the password;
• Changes in password strength must take place in real time;
• How to calculate the strength of a password:
• Only letters/digits/symbols - the password is easy;
• Combination of letters-symbols/letters-digits/digits-symbols - the password is medium;
• Has letters, symbols and numbers - the password is strong;
• The color of the sections will depend on the strength of the password:
• If the field is empty, all sections are gray;
• If the field has less than 8 characters, all sections are red;
• If the password is easy - the first section is red the rest are gray;
• If the password is medium - the first two sections are yellow the last one is gray;
• If the password is strong, all sections are green;

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
